In winter, a <strong>24-hour Snow Route Parking Ban</strong> can be declared on signed routes with eight hours' notice, per the <a href=\"https://www.saskatoon.ca/sites/default/files/Service%20Level%20for%20Snow%20and%20Ice%20Management%20revised%20revised%20jan8_0.pdf\">Service Level for Snow and Ice Management</a>. Temporary 'No Parking' signs may also restrict parking for snow removal (typically <strong>07:00-19:00</strong> or <strong>19:00-07:00</strong>), and vehicles can be ticketed and relocated - use the City's tools if your car is moved. No general overnight permit is required, but RPZs exist near busy areas. Tip: do not exceed 72 hours and move when yellow signs appear to avoid towing under snow emergency parking rules."
